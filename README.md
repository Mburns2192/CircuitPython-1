This repository will actually serve as a aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.

```python

import time
import digitalio
from lcd.lcd import LCD

from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull 

btn= DigitalInOut(board.D8)
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.DOWN

switch = DigitalInOut(board.D9)
switch.direction = Direction.INPUT
switch.pull = Pull.UP

# get and i2c object
i2c = board.I2C()

# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x3f), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)

value = 0
SwitchState = switch.value

lcd.print("Button:")   #prints what is in the quotes to the lcd 
lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,8)

prev_state = btn.value

while True:
    cur_state = btn.value

    if cur_state != prev_state:  
        if not cur_state:
            value+=1
            lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,8)
            lcd.print(str(value))
    if switch.value == True:
      lcd.set_cursor_pos(1,0)
      lcd.print("True")
    else:
      
      lcd.set_cursor_pos(1,0)
      lcd.print("False")

    prev_state = cur_state
